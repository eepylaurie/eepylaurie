### ☁️ hey, Laurie here.

Currently moving through the *Core Curriculum* at *42Heilbronn*, spending most of my time strengthening my skills through hands-on work.  
Outside of that, I pursue small personal ideas that let me play with visuals and creative direction.

#### 🍵 These days I'm focused on

- Working on *42 Projects* primarily in `Python` and `C`  
- Learning how to build cute web applications
- Exploring UI aesthetics and visual layout design

#### 🍡 When I'm not Coding

- Playing cozy games
- Drawing
- Collecting Pokémon
- Sleeping whenever possible

*still learning, still experimenting, still figuring things out...*
